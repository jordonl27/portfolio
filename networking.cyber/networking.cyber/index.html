<h2 id="h2">Hardware</h2>

<p id="pcolor">CPU</p>
<p id="ptext">The CPU controls the interpretation and execution of instructions. the CPU of a PC consists of a single microprocessor, while the CPU of a more powerful mainframe consists of multiple processing devices, and in some cases hundreds.</p>
<p id="pcolor">RAM</p>  
<p id="ptext">RAM stands for random access memory. RAM is essentially short term memory where data is stored as the processor needs it. RAM is volatile memory</p>

<p id="pcolor">DRAM</p>
<p id="ptext">DRAM is a type of semiconductor memory that is typically needed by a computer processor to function. DRAM is a common type of random access memory that is used in personal computers, workstations and servers.</p>

<p id="pcolor">SDRAM</p>
<p id="ptext">SDRAM(synchronous DRAM) is a generic name for various kinds of dynamic random access memory (DRAM)that are synchronized with the clock speed that the microprocessor is optimized for. This tends to increase the number of instructions that the processor can perform in a given time.</p>

<p ID="pcolor">RDRAM</p>
<P id="ptext">RDRAM is a type of computer device active memory developed and licensed by Rambus inc</P>

<p id="pcolor">DDR,2,3,4,5</p>
<p id="ptext">Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory, is a double data rate synchronous dynamic random-access memory class of memory of intergratedcircuits used in computers. DDR SDRAM, is also retroactively called<span id="p3"> DDR2, DDR3, DDR4</span> and<span id="p3"> DDR5 SDRAM.</span></p>

<p id="pcolor">non-DDR</p>
<p id="ptext">non-DDR or SDRAM runs at a slower speed as it only uses the rising edge of the clock signal.DDR uses both edges, so can transfer data at roughly twice the speed </p>

<p id="pcolor">Router</p>
<P id="ptext">Routers connect other computers and other devices to the internet. A router acts as a dispatcher, choosing the best route for your information to travel. They are used for coupling networks or for connecting branch offices to a central office via VPN.</P>

<p id="pcolor">Switch</p>
<p id="ptext">A network switch is networking hardware that connects devices on a computer network. A switch is required if there are wired devices on a network.</p>

<p id="pcolor">WAP</p>
<p id="ptext">A Wireless Access Point or WAP is a device that creates a wireless local area network, or WLAN, usually in an office or large building. An access point connects to a wired router, switch or hub via an Ethernet cable and projects a WiFi signal to a designated area. </p>

<h2 id="h20">Topography</h2>

<p id="pcolor2">Star</p>
<p id="ptext">A Star network is an implementation of a spoke-hub distribution paradigm in computer networks. In a Star network, every host is connected to a central hub. In its simplest form, one central hub acts as a conduit to transmit messages. this is one of the most common computer network topologys.</p>

<p id="pcolor2">Bus</p>
<p id="ptext">A Bus network, also known as line topology, is a type of network topology in which all devices in the network are connected by one central RJ-45 network cable or coaxil cable.the cable is referred to as the trunk.</p>

<p id="pcolor2" >Ring</p>
<p id="ptext">A Ring topology is a type of network topology in which each device is connected to two other devices on either side via an RJ-45 cable. This forms a circular ring of connected devices which give it its name. Data is commonly transferred in one direction along the ring, known as a unidirectional ring.</p>

<p id="pcolor2" >Mesh</p>
<p id="ptext">A Mesh topology is a local area network topology in which the infrastructure nodes connect directly, dynamically and non-hierarchically to as many other nodes as possible and cooperate with one anotehr to efficiently route data to and from clients.</p>
